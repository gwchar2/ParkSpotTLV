## Project Overview

ParkSpot TLV is a **smart parking solution for Tel Aviv**, integrating geospatial data, zone-based parking policies, and mobile convenience. It combines a robust **ASP.NET Core Web API backend**, a **PostGIS-powered database**, and a **.NET MAUI Android app** for a seamless parking experience.

### Key Features

- Real-time zone classification and parking rules
- Interactive map overlays with Google Maps or MapLibre
- Daily parking budget tracking and auto-stop sessions
- Secure authentication using Argon2ID, JWT, and HMAC
- Cross-platform development and containerized deployment

---

## System Architecture
The ParkSpot TLV project is divided into three major components:
1. **Backend API** ‚Äì ASP.NET Core Web API with EF Core and PostGIS
2. **Database** ‚Äì PostgreSQL + PostGIS (for spatial data and zone management)
3. **Mobile App** ‚Äì .NET MAUI Android client with Google Maps integration
