Morning: update local main, rebase your branch (Every day when you start)
git fetch origin                 # get remote updates
git switch main
git pull --ff-only               # fast-forward your local main
Start a task (new branch)
git switch -c <branch_name>
# ...edit code…




During the day: commit in small, meaningful chunks; push whenever:
you reached a checkpoint,
you want CI to run,
you want your teammate to see progress,
or you just want a safe remote backup.

git add -A
git commit -m "feat: draw colored segments on map"
First push of a branch: 	git push -u origin <branch_name>
Else: 				git push 

Keep your branch in sync with latest main
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
# resolve any conflicts if needed

Open a PR (recommended)
On GitHub: compare <branch_name> → into main.





After review & merge, delete the branch (GitHub offers a button).
Start the next task
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c  <branch_name>
Quick sanity checks
git status       # what changed locally
git branch -vv   # what branch you’re on + upstream
git remote -v    # where “origin” points
